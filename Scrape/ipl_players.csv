A top-order batter for Mumbai, Rahane scored over 1000 runs in his second Ranji season, helping the side secure their 38th title win. He made his Test debut in 2013, after months of travelling with the squad, and then in his third match, he scored 51 not out and 96 in Durban. His first Test century followed soon, in a draw in Wellington in February 2014. Five months later, he was in the vanguard for India's first win at Lord's in nearly three decades, setting the game up with a solid 103 in the first innings. He followed it up with his maiden ODI century, at Edgbaston, as India wrapped up the ODI series 3-1."

Four years later he'd score another double, but this time for New Zealand on his Test debut, becoming only the second - but also the oldest - player to do so in the side, where he quickly established himself as an attacking but composed top-order batter with the ability to shift gears quickly to adapt to match situations. After moving to New Zealand at 26, following that 2017 game against Border, Johannesburg-born Conway was handed a contract by Wellington for the 2018-19 domestic season. The next season he was the top run-scorer in all three domestic competitions, including a triple-century against Canterbury in Wellington's Plunket Shield-winning campaign that gave them the title for the first time since 2003-04."

But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann. While many critics dismissed him as a ""part-time"" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. And while he suffered more than his share of ups and downs, for the next five years he manfully carried the load in one of the most under-resourced areas of the English game. When he was dropped during the 2019 Ashes, subsequently losing his central contract, it turned out to be the beginning of the end for Moeen as a Test allrounder; nevertheless, on calling time in 2021, he finished just shy of 3000 Test runs and 200 wickets, making him England's third most-prolific spinner of all time."

Within his first year of white-ball debut in domestic cricket, Dube had started hitting boundaries in the lower order and picking wickets. His Ranji Trophy debut also put him in the spotlight when he bagged a five-for to dismiss five of Karnataka's top six batters, combined with a brisk 71 down the order. But the headline moment came when he smashed five sixes in an over off Pravin Tambe in a Mumbai T20 league game and repeated the feat in a Ranji match against Baroda, just a day before the IPL auction in December 2018. That season, Dube had also taken a seven-for against Karnataka and struck his maiden first-class century. Those shot his value up so much that RCB splurged Rs 5 crore for him. However, he couldn't prove to be the finisher RCB wanted him to be for two seasons and he switched to Rajasthan Royals for the 2020 season."

In October 2019 he became the quickest left-arm bowler to reach 200 Test wickets. Six years before that, he had became the first Indian since Anil Kumble in 1993 to top the ICC ODI bowling rankings. In the IPL, he drew a scarcely believable bid of US$2 million in 2012."

He impressed, making an assured 73 against England in his first innings and bowling with good control on a sluggish surface at his home ground, Hamilton. Mitchell, the son of former New Zealand rugby union player and coach John Mitchell, scored his first Test hundred at the start of 2021, in an innings win over Pakistan in Christchurch, and his first ODI century that March. In T20Is, when promoted to open at the 2021 T20 World Cup, he played a key role in New Zealand's run to the final, with an unbeaten 72 against England in the semi-final. Though New Zealand had a poor tour of England in 2022, losing all three Tests, Mitchell came out of the summer glowing, with two fifties and three hundreds, including a massive one at Trent Bridge. And he made a quick fifty against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup semi-final that year, though in a losing cause."

After featuring in two Under-19 World Cups for New Zealand, Ravindra made a seamless transition into international cricket. He broke into the New Zealand senior team in 2021 and on his Test debut against a spin-heavy India attack that included R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, he played out 91 balls in the final innings to help New Zealand salvage a draw in Kanpur."

He was named in the one-day squad for the tour of England following the retirement of Daniel Vettori after the World Cup as New Zealand searched for another left-arm spin option. Santner was in to cover for the absence of the players at the IPL but made an immediate impression with a well-crafted 94 in a tour game against Somerset. He was handed his ODI debut at Edgbaston having played just 19 List A matches for Northern Districts. ""It's nice to have a left-arm spinner who turns,"" was a quip from the New Zealand camp."

Deshpande came through by picking wickets in the Cooch Behar Trophy and started his first-class career with a bang, in 2016-17, when he bagged 19 wickets in his first five Ranji Trophy games and ended the season with a tally of 21 when Mumbai finished as runners-up. He was also handy with the white ball, proven by his tally of 15 in eight games when Mumbai lifted the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2018-19. He was, however, on the fringes of the Mumbai set-up and got chances mainly when one of Shardul Thakur or Dhawal Kulkarni was unavailable. A no-ball problem also affected his consistency. He became a regular feature after the 2018-19 season when he was also picked for the Duleep Trophy and made his IPL debut in 2020 for Delhi Capitals (DC). After he blew hot and cold that season, he was picked up by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the mega auction in 2022, which gave him only two match opportunities."

It was the culmination of an extraordinary rise through the ranks: he was a late-bloomer, who made his first professional appearance aged 27 as a trialist at Northamptonshire, and had nearly quit the game altogether the previous winter due to injury. Gleeson proved himself an integral part of Northamptonshire's NatWest T20 Blast side in 2016. He missed Finals Day - their third in four years and one in which they emerged victorious - but he had done much to get them there, showing splendid economy levels, under six an over, with aggressive, full-length bowling and mastery of the yorker under pressure. It was all enough to win him a berth with Rangpur Riders in the 2016 Bangladesh Premier League."

He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. He made his first-class debut for Khulna in the 2013-14 season and, after taking eight wickets in the U-19 World Cup in the UAE, he was surprisingly picked for Bangladesh A's tour of West Indies. Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08."

Thakur picked up eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match."

He couldn't quite extend that wicket-taking form into the World Cup, but was a regular presence in the side. Khaleel was bought by Delhi Daredevils for INR 10 lakh at the IPL auction in 2016, thereby extending his association with Rahul Dravid who served as India's Under-19 coach and is also the Daredevils' team mentor."

Mukesh was picked by the Cricket Association of Bengal in their trials when he had not even played club cricket. When he had moved from Bihar, his home state, in 2014, he was primarily a tennis-ball cricket player who would get tired easily and the doctors had said he was anemic. He was later also diagnosed with bone edema in his knees but over time he gained considerable strength while working under Ranadeb Bose and Waqar Younis.

That earned him an ODI debut in March 2019 as well as call-ups to the IPL and the 50-over World Cup, although injury sidelined him from the latter two tournaments. Later that year, he got the chance to make his Test debut in India, and his ability to bend his back on the docile tracks stood out even as South Africa slumped to one Test defeat after another.

Having made his one-day debut for Western Australia at the age of 19 in 2015-16, and his Sheffield Shield debut later that season, Richardson was a surprise selection in Australia's T20I squad to play Sri Lanka in February 2017. His call-up came on the back of a productive BBL season in which he collected 11 wickets, and most notably was Player of the Match in the final, when he ran through the Sydney Sixers middle-order to help Perth Scorchers to the title.

For one who started playing serious cricket at 14, Ishant's rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18, followed by his first Test on India's tour of Bangladesh in May 2007, but it was in Australia that he made people sit up.

That century also meant he would not have to carry out his intention of following his father into the army if he did not make it as a professional cricketer. But his barnstorming start did not immediately translate into an India call-up and Pandey continued to work his way up in the domestic circuit.

With his debut series coinciding with Kumble's last, it was the opening he needed to establish himself as India's first-choice legspinner. But, his inability to extract turn on benign pitches and the lack of accuracy were his failings as other spinners overtook him in the pecking order."

Like many of his compatriots, he is an in-demand commodity in franchise leagues across the world.
Born in Kabul, Naveen fled with his family to Pakistan in his early years, and began playing tape-ball cricket there. When they returned to Afghanistan, he began playing with a leather ball for the first time. He was so impressive for Afghanistan's Under-16 and Under-19 teams that his first professional match at the senior level was his ODI debut against Bangladesh, just two days after he turned 17.
Naveen made seven sporadic ODI appearances from his debut to January 2021, and a year later he took a break from the format to focus on the 2022 T20 World Cup. In the meantime, he became an integral part of Afghanistan's T20I side, either side of captaining Afghanistan to a fourth-place finish at the 2018 Under-19 World Cup.
Stints at the BPL, CPL, LPL and the T20 Blast followed as he began to build his reputation. In 2023, Naveen announced he would retire from ODIs after the World Cup that year. He took eight wickets as Afghanistan put in an impressive display in the competition, finishing sixth on the table.
By then, he had made his IPL debut as well, taking 11 wickets in his first season for Lucknow Super Giants, and was also in the news for an on-field altercation with Virat Kohli.
Towards the end of 2024, Naveen along with team-mates Fazalhaq Farooqi and Mujeeb-ur-Rahman got in trouble with the Afghanistan Cricket Board after they asked to be released from their central contracts so they could sign up for more franchise leagues. The board responded by revoking the players' NOCs and denying them further NOCs for the next two years. The situation was resolved with the board agreeing to grant them a limited number of NOCs and slapping them with financial penalties.
Naveen returned 14 wickets in IPL 2024, but it was in the T20 World Cup that year that he really shone. Naveen and Farooqi combined to take the spotlight away from Afghanistan's spinners as they made the semi-finals of a World Cup for the first time. Naveen finished the tournament with 13 wickets, and his three-wicket burst was one of the highlights of Afghanistan's first-ever victory over Australia in any format."

Pursuing cricket was not easy for Bishnoi. His father, a headmaster at a government school, did not like the idea. But his mother loved the sport and would watch cricket with him on television while his father was at school.

Those displays spurred Mumbai Indians to bag Shreyas for his base price of INR 10 lakh in the 2014 IPL auction. Sharp turn rather than accuracy is Shreyas' forte, and Karnataka have tended to use him in short bursts rather than over long spells.

On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side.

He's a colourful character off the field, but in contrast, his bowling, focusing on control, is clinical."

A natural leader, du Plessis was put in charge of the T20 side in February 2013 and formed part of the senior core in other formats."

Not only was it his maiden first-class five-for, he was not even meant to be in the side: he was a late change to the side before the toss with Ben Foakes ruled out through illness. But though his offspin is more than serviceable, Jacks is primarily a powerful top-order batter who has long been tipped for the top. He shot to mainstream attention on Surrey's pre-season tour in 2019, when he hit a 25-ball hundred in a T10 friendly against Lancashire in Dubai, by which stage he had graduated from a spell with England's Under-19s which included a century against India in a Youth Test and the vice-captaincy at the 2018 World Cup."

Over the next ten years, he played just 76 domestic matches, of which 31 came during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. Swapnil claimed 6 for 19, the second-best bowling figures in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament, and was later bought for INR 10 lakhs by the erstwhile Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) at the 2016 IPL auction.

Sundar loved to bowl but only in matches because he found it boring to just field. He eventually started to take it seriously under the eye of former India offspiner M Venkataramana. Sundar bowls with great discipline, and held his own in domestic one-day competitions and after making his Twenty20 debut as a 17-year-old in the IPL."
Pinnaduwage Wanindu Hasaranga de Silva,https://wassets.hscicdn.com/static/images/lazyimage-transparent.png,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Allrounder,"A bruising lower-middle order batsman, and an aggressive legbreak bowler, Wanidu Hasaranga graduated from a strong Richmond College outfit, had a fine run in Sri Lanka's 2015 and 2016 Under-19 teams, and has made a promising start to his domestic cricket career. Though it was his bowling that largely impressed at the Under-19 level - he claimed a particularly impactful 3 for 34 in the 2016 Youth World Cup quarter-final against England - batting was Hasaranga's stronger suit in his first two seasons of senior cricket. Hasaranga made a rapid 87 on first-class debut with Ports Authority Cricket Club, and, having switched to Colombo Cricket Club, hit 586 runs at an average of 39.06 and a strike rate of 93 in the 2017 Premier League Tournament."

The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances. By 2023 he had led the team to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup."

Farooqi is now the go-to man with the new ball for Afghanistan, and most teams that he represents in franchise leagues around the globe. After working with Dwayne Bravo across franchises as well as during his stint as Afghanistan's fast-bowling consultant, Farooqi has developed his death-bowling skills to become a potent weapon."

In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013. Bhuvneshwar demonstrated his mastery of line and length early, when at 19 he worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first duck in domestic first-class cricket, in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy final. He was handy with the bat too - in the 2012-13 Duleep Trophy semi-final he scored 128 batting at No. 8."

A product of tennis-ball cricket, Malik did not even know there existed shoes with spikes for fast bowlers until he went for his first Under-19 trial. He had played just one List A match and one T20 when he joined SRH as a short-term Covid replacement for T Natarajan. He got his chance only after SRH were out of the race for the playoffs. He made an immediate impact and, despite playing just three games that season, was retained by SRH ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction."

He was first spotted at the Duleep Sinh School of Cricket in Porbandar, where he impressed his coach Ram Odedra with his bowling action and ability to land the ball on the seam. After the World Cup, Unadkat was handed an IPL contract with Kolkata Knight Riders and he impressed the bowling coach Wasim Akram, who identified him as one for the future. He was picked for India A's tour of England in June 2010 and had a dream first-class debut, taking a match-winning 13 for 103 against West Indies A at Grace Road. A month later, he joined the Indian Test squad in Sri Lanka as a nets bowler and was included in the squad for the year-end tour of South Africa, where he made his Test debut at Centurion. However, it was a forgettable one, as he went wicketless in 26 overs for 101 runs. He was duly dropped from the Test team, and made a return to the domestic circuit. A significant breakthrough came during India's A tour of New Zealand in 2012-13, where he picked up nine List-A wickets at an average of 15.77 with two four-wicket hauls. He then enjoyed a largely successful campaign with Royal Challengers Bangalore, finishing joint-second on the team's wicket-takers list. His consistent performances helped him gain selection for India's tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, where he made his ODI debut. It proved a largely successful trip, as he picked up eight wickets in five matches. He later played two more ODIs in the upcoming home season - against Australia and West Indies - but went wicketless in both."

He made his Sri Lanka debut at the Asian Games in Hangzhou. He also impressed with eight wickets in four outings at an economy of 5.43 for title winners MI Emirates in the ILT20 tournament. He has also represented Chattogram Challengers in the Bangladesh Premier League."
